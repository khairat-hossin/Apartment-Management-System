                        I'm married and have a three and a half year old that means the world to me.
                        Family life has always been the most important part of my life, so lets begin here.

                    <p>
                        You never know how much you miss school until you're out. After achieving a number of my goals,
                        I realized that having a higher education is what matters most.
